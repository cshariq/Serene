# SERENE

Can't hear your friend talking on the highway? Do you need to blast your music just to hear it well? Well, you're in luck, because **Serene** is a portable noise-cancelling device that can remove all of that noise!

Just stick it to the roof of your car, and Serene will capture the road noise and output sounds waves that cancel them out, so that you can enjoy a peaceful car ride. 

Serene is a small, portable device that connects directly to your phone and car speaker. It sticks seamlessly to the walls of your car, and using ANC algorithms, it minimizes the external noise that it picks up inside the car.

## Inspiration 

During family road trips, I sat in the backseat as a child, and if I didn't yell, my parents in the front couldn't hear me. This was so annoying, as a long highway drive almost always came with losing my voice. 

With my dad's hearing getting worse, I figured that we needed a way to drown out the road noise. I was desparate for a solution, so taking inspiration from noise-cancelling technology in headphones, I thought: "What if we did the same thing in cars?". 

Asking around to gather interest for this project, my chemistry teacher also said that she wishes her 1 and a half hour commute in the morning was quieter. So, with another client that could benefit, we began developing Serene. 

While a few very luxury cars offer ANC, we wanted to make ANC more accessible to all people, because everyone deserves sereneness!
